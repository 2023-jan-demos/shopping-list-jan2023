## The Golden Rule:

π¦Έ π¦ΈββοΈ `Stop starting and start finishing.` π

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

-   Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
-   Consider your data model.
    -   What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
    -   What are the key/value pairs?
    -   What arrays might you need?
    -   What needs to live in a persistence layer?
-   Is there some state we need to initialize?
-   Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be reused?)

# Data Model
`shopping_list_items`
- id
- created_at
- item
- quantity
- is_bought
- user_id (we need as user_id because this is how we will use RLS rules to rescrict who can CRUD a shopping list item)

## Auth Page
- comes with the template

## List Page
slices / features / user stories
1) on submit, user should be able to add an item and its quantity
    - get form data in a submit listener
        - do all the form stuff
            - e.preventDefault()
            - 'submit'
            - <input name="quantity" />
            - `const data = new FormData(myFormEl);`
            - `data.get('quantity')`
    - using the form data, we send that data to supabase to create a new list_item
2) on load, fetch, render, and append the items the user already added in the past, (but only THEIR OWN ITEMS)
    - fetch the user's list items
    - put them in steate
    - clear the DOM out 
    - and display the list_items
3) on submit, user should be able to see the items they added, (but only THEIR OWN ITEMS)
    - after creating a new item, 
        - fetch the user's list items
        - put them in steate
        - clear the DOM out 
        - and re-display the list_items
4A) on click of an item, user should be able to designate the item as "bought", (but only THEIR OWN ITEMS)
    - after we render each item, add an event listener
        - on click of the item, call supabase to update the item by id
        - fetch the user's list items
        - put them in steate
        - clear the DOM out 
        - and display the list_items
4B) when rendering the list, items that are 'bought' should be rendered differently, (but only THEIR OWN ITEMS)
    - in our renderListItem function
    - look at the boolean is_bought
    - if is_bought is true, put a new class on the element
5) on load, if user is logged in, display the email in header
